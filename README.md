# Introduction

Noting down MergeSort for everytime I have to remember it for interviews.

# How Merge Sort works in my words

1. If the length of the array is more than 1 continue
2. Get the middle of the array
3. Split it left and right
4. Repeat steps 1-3 for each left and right array.
5. When the array size is 1 merge the left and right based on size order.

# Time Complexity

MergeSort has a stable O(n log n) time complexity regardless of the sorting scenarios.

# Space Complexity

MergeSort needs extra arrays so has O(n) space complexities.
